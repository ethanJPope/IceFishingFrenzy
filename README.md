# Ice Fishing Frenzy
A fun, pixel art style, game based off of the game Tiny Fishing made fully in Unity. This game was a fun process from coming up with the idea to the final product. This game is a fun fishing game leening into the arcade style rather than the realistic style. My aim for this week of Siege was polish over complex gamplay. With this aproch I was able to have less buggy code, lots more time for the art, and I even had time for a full hand draw/ cool looking title(one of my favorite parts).

## How to play
When you first load into the game it will shwo you the title screen. Then when you click play it will open up the game view. To cast click the space bar and once you reach the depth level the hook will begin to rise. This is when you can catch the fish by moving the hook with left/right with the arrow keys or a/d keys. Then when your hook is full you cannot catch any more fish. Once you reach the top again it will score your catch and open the upgrades menu which is where you can upgrade your depth/how much your hook can hold. To go back to gamplay click the "Continue" button in the top left corner.

## How I made this project
To begin I started brainstorm by talking back and forth with ChatGPT until it gave me the idea of a realistic ice fishing game. At this point I had rememered this fun game on Coolmathgames called Tiny Fishing, which is an arcade styled game where you control the hook and as you upgrade more and more to go deeper and deeper you will find increasingly valuble fish. So this was my inspirataion for my game. I began with drafting out the simple mechanics of this game such as: Casting, Reeling, Upgrades, and Spawning fish. Once I had these in place I began on the art, and since pixel art is all I know how to do ok enough I started there. Firsh I made the background. Then the fish. And lastly the title that you first see when you open the game(this one took so much longer than the others). Once I had the art ready I dropped it into the game with one more mechanic in the game, which was changing the fish sprite based off of how deep it was. For the last thing I made a Web build of my project and put it on itch.io. I would love to here what you thought of it. https://ethanp314.itch.io/icefishingfrenzy

## Things I wished I had time to add
- When your hook is full it reels up a lot fast(since you can't catch any more fish)
- A string for the hook
- A better upgrade menu
- More fish(once you get deep enough there just is no fish)
- Better fish spawning script(right now it is really hard to add new fish to the script)
